            <ul type="disk">
                <li> Accessing update information on developments in the forestry sector </li>
                <li> Keeping you informed of issues affecting growers in Donegal</li>
                <li> Developing markets for produce from your woodlands</li>
                <li> Marketing your timber</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text"> To be eligible for membership applicants must own woodland located in Co. Donegal. Each member owns one share in the Society, irrespective of the size of their woodland. The share has a value of â‚¬5. The Society has been financed to date by membership fees, charges for goods and services provided and a start up grant from the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The voluntary commitment of the members has resulted in huge cost savings to the group.</p>
